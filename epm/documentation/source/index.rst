Welcome to EPM's documentation!
===============================

It is possible to predict an algorithms performance on previously unseen input.
This is achieved by building a model on an algorithm's performance as a function of
problem-specific instance features. These types of models are called **Empirical Performance Models** (*EPM*).
An EPM can make performance predictions for algorithms whose parameters are declared as real, integer, ordinal and categorical, as well as conditional parameters that are only active dependent on other parameters.
